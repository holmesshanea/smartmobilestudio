Layout2

Creates a Panel on the form and aligns it to the dimensions of the form and adds a margin of 5

It is  the same as doing a fPanel.SetBounds(5,5,width-10,height-10);

It takes more code to do it with a Layout, but you will soon see how powerfull Layout is and what it can do and setBounds cant do.
