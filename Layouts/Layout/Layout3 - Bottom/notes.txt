Layout3 - Bottom

Creates a Panel on the form and aligns it to the bottom of the form with a height of 50

It is  the same as doing a fPanel.SetBounds(0,height-50,width, height);

It takes more code to do it with a Layout, but you will soon see how powerfull Layout is and what it can do and setBounds cant do.
