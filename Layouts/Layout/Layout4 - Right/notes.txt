Layout4 - Right

Creates a Panel on the form and aligns it to the Right of the form with a width of 50

It is  the same as doing a fPanel.SetBounds(Width-50,0,width, height);

It takes more code to do it with a Layout, but you will soon see how powerfull Layout is and what it can do and setBounds cant do.
